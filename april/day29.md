* It's interesting to note that Facebook groups are a modern form of tribalism. But because so many of us have become so accepting of one another, we are also open to the idea of groups mixing.

* It'd be interesting if similarly to listing calories and such on a food item before buying it, it listed how many animals went into making it. Films with animals in them often say "No animals were harmed in the making of this food." Imagine if meals said "3/4ths of a chicken were harmed in the making of this meal."

* Robotics Unlimited has a really interesting legged-wheel system. It'd be even more interesting to port that legged-wheel system over to other vehicles, like bicycles, and see how they perform offroad and on stairs and such.

* Governments could automate assassination fairly easily. If Facebook had access to a military, they could probably even pull it off. Facebook can probabilistically infer each person in a photo via a combination of where the photo was taken and who uploaded it. The facial recognition becomes extraordinarily accurate with these parameters in place. Governments know our location from our phones, while also posessing our face image data from our ID photos and social media uploads. If they wanted to, they could strap a camera and a gun to a quadrotor drone, give it location data, and send it out to kill someone.

* A car that has a sauna in the back seat. The fogginess of the windows that ensues is a privacy feature.
